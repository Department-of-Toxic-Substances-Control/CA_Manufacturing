#Read in data csv files for comparison. There are 40,297 total FRS facilities, and we need to see if there are additional manufacturing locations to consider that may be registered under other reporting systems. 
#frs, eis, cers and tri have all been manicured for the NAICS and SIC codes that we are interested in for this project.
#facilities.csv is a list of all FRS facilities in California and the associated facility codes joined in for our comparison of data sets.

#Now we can try a similar process using the "facilities" df to compare EIS facility codes in the EIS data and FRS data.
#First, we need to create a trimmed df of EIS facilities only. 
#Next, we need to pull in the EIS Facility ID from the facilities df. Then compare to the frs_trim df using the same method we used for TRI.

#There are 6,745 NEW facilities from the EIS data that do not match up to a FRS Registry ID. However, we need to see how many facilities overlap with FRS data.
